# API Key for the backlinktool.io API
api_key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

# The CompetitorAnalysis class in your competitor_analysis.rb file
# is designed to fetch SEO metrics from a given URL. The base URL for
# the API calls is https://example.com/api/seo_metrics.

# However, example.com is a placeholder and not a real API service.
# You should replace this with the URL of a real third-party service that provides
# SEO metrics.

# There are several third-party services that provide SEO metrics, such as:

# SEMrush: Offers an API that provides data on website traffic, keyword rankings, backlinks, and much more.
# Ahrefs: Provides an API that offers data on backlinks, keyword rankings, and other SEO metrics.
# Moz: Their API (known as "Mozscape") provides data on website metrics, backlinks, keyword rankings, and more.

# Please note that these services are not free, and you will need to sign up for an API key to use them.
# Once you have an API key, you can replace https://example.com/api/seo_metrics with the actual API URL and
# store the API key in your config.yaml file as I described in the previous responses.
